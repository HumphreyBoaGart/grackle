# /void/

The `/void/` directory is a routable dead-end, where we have the web server dump some of the more bullshit requests. It is owned by root, set to read-only, and it cannot serve dynamic scripts.

Edit [index.html](index.html) to modify how this page displays to the outside world. By default, this page is just a copy of `400.html` from the adjacent [/errors/](/errors/) directory.
