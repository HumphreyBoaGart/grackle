# ~/private_html/

The `/private_html` directory is a predefined spot in your application's home directory for storing application code that you do not want visible to the web server. This lets you reduce the attack footprint of your app.

You can make more directories like this, but you will generally not need more than one unless there is a specific way you like to do homedirs for your apps *(which you are also free to do)*.
