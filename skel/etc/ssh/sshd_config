# GRACKLE SSH CONFIG - sshd_config
# Generated From: /opt/grackle/skel/etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Saves To: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
#
# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.
# See sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This file was copied here from /opt/grackle/skel/etc/ssh/sshd_config

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.
#
# Some of these are deliberately uncommented & set to default as a failsafe.
# This file will likely be reorganized in future releases.

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing,

# be allowed through the KbdInteractiveAuthentication and
# PasswordAuthentication.  Depending on your PAM configuration,

# the setting of "PermitRootLogin prohibit-password".
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and KbdInteractiveAuthentication to 'no'.

# GRACKLE PERMISSIONS BLOCK - DO NOT MODIFY!
# Grackle's chrooting+password policy depends on a very
# specific layering of options, to preserve SFTP access
# for chrooted low-level accounts, but restrict insecure
# access to administrator accounts. Messing with this
# block WILL adversely affect your server's security in
# several ways, so please don't molest it.
