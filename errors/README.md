# /errors/

The `/errors/` directory is where we store all the error pages for the web server. These are all self-contained flat HTML files, because we really don't want the server wasting bandwidth/cpu/etc on error reporting and bad requests. Just as with [/void/](/void/), this is a read-only directory with no ability to execute dynamic scripts.
